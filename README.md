# SOS Morse Code v1.4

SOS Morse Code is an iOS application on the App Store. It's a small utility designed to transmit English to Morse Code using the LED or the main LCD screen on the device.


## Next Update 3.0
I think the next update will be quite substantial in terms of the UI/UX. While viewing Macrumors I saw an image of the Hallide app and this triggered a new interface for SOS Morse Code.

## Thank you.
Thanks for using SOS Morse Code. It means a lot to me as a developer and as someone that builds apps to help others. I hope it has helped you in some way. Please reach out to me on X (Twitter) @_markwong_ or @_whizbangapps or
